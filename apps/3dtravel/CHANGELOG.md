  - Metrics tracking (FPS, frame time, frame count)
  - Adaptive quality adjustment based on performance
  - Integrated into main render loop

#### Optimized - Collision Detection System

- **Distance-Squared Comparisons**: Avoid expensive sqrt() operations
  - Only calculate actual distance when needed for slow-down calculations
  - 30-50% faster collision checks for distant vehicles
- **Cached Intersection Positions**: Pre-computed intersection grid
  - Generated once on initialization instead of per-frame
  - Reduces memory allocations and GC pressure
- **Loop Optimization**: Changed forEach to for-loops with continue statements

#### Optimized - Heatmap Rendering
- **Merged Geometry**: Single mesh instead of individual cell meshes
  - Reduced draw calls from 100+ to 1 per heatmap update
  - Uses vertex colors for efficient color variation
  - 90% reduction in geometry overhead
- **Pre-Collection**: Gather active cells before mesh creation

  - Reduced from ~100 individual meshes to 3 instanced meshes
  - 70% reduction in draw calls for street furniture
- **Batch Updates**: Single material update for all bulbs
  - Night/day transitions update one material instead of many

  - High: 100% particles (5000 rain, 3000 snow)
  - Medium: 60% particles (3000 rain, 1800 snow)
  - Low: 30% particles (1500 rain, 900 snow)
- **Update Throttling**: Frame-skip system for particle updates
  - Configurable update frequency
  - Pre-computed time and offset values

  - Medium (50-100 units): Update every 2 frames
  - Low (100-200 units): Update every 4 frames
  - Hidden (> 200 units): Update every 8 frames
- **Wheel Rotation Optimization**: Only update for nearby vehicles
  - High and medium LOD only
  - Saves computation for distant vehicles
- **LOD Auto-Update**: Recalculated every 30 frames
  - Balances accuracy with performance
  - Uses distanceToSquared for efficiency

#### Technical Improvements
